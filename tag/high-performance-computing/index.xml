      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first became interested in HPC in 2011 during my M.S. coursework. After a brief Human-Computer Interaction episode, I returned to HPC in 2014 and worked in this field ever since. Between 2014 and 2019, I worked on Saudi Aramco&amp;rsquo;s reservoir simulator - GigaPOWERS and had the chance to lead the performance optimization records. During that time, I had the chance to run on several &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.top500.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TOP500&lt;/a&gt;-ranked supercomputers and achieve a few milestones: evaluate the scalability up to 196&#39;609 cores back in 2017, and was involved in record-setting 1-billion-cell simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of those projects I gained extensive experience with domain partitioning, matrix-vector multiplication optimization, OpenMP, fast compression algorithms, MPI tuning and asynchronous I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2020, I started to work on an h/p/r-adaptive framework developed at KAUST&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/aanslab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;AANSLab&lt;/a&gt; used to simulate turbulent compressible internal and external flows on unstructured grids for industrial applications. I focus on the solver&amp;rsquo;s performance, communication, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
