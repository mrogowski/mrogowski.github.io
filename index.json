Keystroke dynamics is one of the biometric methods that can be used to authenticate or identify users. The method falls under behavioral features and is based on how a user performs specific tasks - in this case - how the user types on a keyboard. The typing style was shown to differentiate well between users.\nThe idea first came as early as 1975 when it was mentioned by R. J. Spillane and has since then been modified and improved on multiple occasions with the results reported as high as 99-100% correct classification. The method can be used for both authentication (strengthening the password or continuously verifying the user\u0026rsquo;s identity) or identification (determining the user based on his typing style).\nMy work started by analyzing the impact of the database quality on the method\u0026rsquo;s efficiency and continued with the implementation of a JavaScript-based website to collect experimental data. My most significant contributions, however, were in the area of user authentication on mobile devices. Back in 2012, when smartphones started rapidly gaining popularity, I researched authentication methods on mobile devices and proposed keystroke dynamics as one of the solutions. I then implemented a custom Android keyboard that collected extra information from the touchscreen and the gyroscope as users were typing.

Inefficient work distribution impedes scalability and leads to inefficient use of computing resources. Rather than addressing the more popular - and admittedly more important - topic of grid partitioning, this paper delves into the problem of the assignment of wells to processes. In the presented method, well activity mask is first obtained using a proxy model. Using this information, the well assignment task is translated to a bin packing problem and First Fit Decreasing algorithm is applied. Depending on the percentage of the simulation time that an average well is active, the results show between 8.2% and 73.8% improvement in terms of the number of bins. The number of bins is directly correlated with the maximum number of processes that can be assigned at most one well at a time which is beneficial in scenarios where the number of wells is greater than the number of processes assigned to the simulation run.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Static Well Assignment in Parallel Reservoir Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Suha Kayum","Marcin Rogowski"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   --  Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.   -- ","date":1607385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607385600,"objectID":"8d2fcafa96c1a786916710999693c69a","permalink":"https://mrogowski.github.io/publication/2020_eage_guided_dt/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_eage_guided_dt/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, a look-ahead timestep size selection method is introduced, which uses smaller coarsened proxy models to guide the timestep selection of the original high-fidelity model.

The timestep size chosen for the proxy model is used to guide the timestep selection of the fine-grid model. The look-ahead method of utilizing the coarsened model results in a reduction of the timestep cuts in the fine-grid simulation run that would have otherwise occurred. The proposed method has been tested on several synthetic and real-field reservoir models and shown to result in a reduced number of timestep cuts based on the input from the coarsened model.

In this paper, we are presenting a universal representation space based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as opposed to force-directed layouts encountered most often in similar problems. We are discussing the methods we devised to make observing change more convenient in a 3D virtual reality environment.","tags":[],"title":"Observing change in crowded data sets in 3D space-Visualizing gene expression in human tissues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mariusz Rybnik","Piotr Panasiuk","Khalid Saeed","Marcin Rogowski"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   --  Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.   -- ","date":1348617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1348617600,"objectID":"ab0c2c42c83ed4917b5b00b81c591280","permalink":"https://mrogowski.github.io/publication/2012_biometrics_advances/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_biometrics_advances/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper concerns database quality in the Keystroke Dynamics domain. The authors present their own algorithm and test it using two databases: the authors’ own KDS database and Keystroke Dynamics - Benchmark Data Set online database. Following problems are studied theoretically and experimentally: classification accuracy, database representativeness, increase in typing proficiency and finally: time precision in samples acquisition. Results show that the impact of the database uniqueness on the experimental results is substantial and should not be disregarded in classification algorithm evaluation.","tags":[],"title":"Advances in the keystroke dynamics: the practical impact of database quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcin Rogowski","Khalid Saeed"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.   --  Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.   -- ","date":1348272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1348272000,"objectID":"ef321f283617c55a9ff8251176997336","permalink":"https://mrogowski.github.io/publication/2012_biometrics_touch_screen/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_biometrics_touch_screen/","section":"publication","summary":"The focus of this chapter is on security of touch screen devices. The emphasis is placed on smartphones – such as Apple iPhone and Android phones – and tablets – such as Apple iPad. The chapter starts with the description how the touch screen devices are winning a significant share in the market. The current state of the security methods used on these devices is discussed. Deficiencies of prevailing approaches are pointed out, and the need for new authentication mechanisms is reasoned. The hardware available in modern touch screen devices is characterized, and the sensors providing biometric data are described.\nIn the last part of this chapter, some of the new security means using biometric features and potential new directions are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"A study on touch screen devices: User authentication problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mrogowski.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
