abstract="The focus of this chapter is on security of touch screen devices. The emphasis is placed on smartphones -- such as Apple iPhone and Android phones -- and tablets -- such as Apple iPad. The chapter starts with the description how the touch screen devices are winning a significant share in the market. The current state of the security methods used on these devices is discussed. Deficiencies of prevailing approaches are pointed out, and the need for new authentication mechanisms is reasoned. The hardware available in modern touch screen devices is characterized, and the sensors providing biometric data are described.",
